***************************

The Rite Club Companion is a software package which adds several new
features to Pyre. In the future, it will also allow data about your rites to
be uploaded to noxalas.net.

There are several components:

- RITE CLUB PATCHER is a simple tool which can apply (and/or remove) patches
  to Pyre.

- RITE CLUB COMPANION is a more advanced tool which can monitor an ongoing
  rite and (soon!) upload details about it to noxalas.net.

- RITE CLUB VIDEO SERVER allows the Rite Club Companion to automatically
  record video footage of rites.



QUICK INSTRUCTIONS (WINDOWS)
============================

1. If you want to use the video recording feature and also have sound in
your recordings (recommended!), you'll need to install the audio grabber.
This is a DLL for your system, so you need to run the "Install Audio
Grabber.bat" script with administrator privileges.

2. Next, run the "Rite Club Patcher.bat" script. You have to locate
Pyre.exe. This is different from one system to the next, and it depends
heavily on whether you have downloaded Pyre from Steam, GOG, Itch, or
elsewhere.

Your system might be configured differently, but here are some common paths:

    STEAM:   ???
    GOG:     C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Pyre\x64\Pyre.exe
    ITCH:    ???

Now, you should be able to apply the Rite Club patchset to Pyre. You can
always uninstall the patches later, but the Rite Club Companion depends on
them.

3. If you want to record videos, double-click on the "Rite Club Video
Server.bat" script. This program must be continuously running in order to
record video. No video is captured until it receives a signal, which
ordinarily happens the moment a rite begins.

4. Now you can run the "Rite Club Companion.bat" script. This app will
launch Pyre for you in a special mode, so be sure to quit any other
instances of Pyre before continuing.
